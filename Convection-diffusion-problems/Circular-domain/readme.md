This jupyter notebook computes the solution to the convection-diffusion transport equations for a circular domain meshed using a fine Cartesian grid.
The temperature or heat flux at the wall boundaries can be varied, and the script computes the matrix of coefficients and the source term using the upwind interpolation scheme.

The resulting system of linear equations is solved using a CGS method.
