This jupyter notebook solves the convection-diffusion transport equation for the case of a rectangular domain with a velocity field parallel to the horizontal domain boundary.
The temperature and heat flux BC can be varied at each wall boundary.

The notebook creates the discretisation coefficients using the hybrid interpolation scheme and then solves the resulting system of linear equations using the CGS method.
